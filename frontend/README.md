# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built with a frontend using React and a backend server (Node.js/Express or any backend framework you are using). The application allows users to add, update, and delete tasks.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete tasks.
- Filter tasks based on their completion status.
- Responsive design to work on different screen sizes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application locally.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anjalikashyap1/to-do-list.git
cd todo-app


 **Running Frontend and Backend Separately**: The `README.md` provides instructions to run both servers separately by navigating to each folder.


## Running the Application

1. Run the backend and frontend servers separately:

In the terminal window where you installed the backend dependencies

cd backend
npm run dev

2. Run the Frontend Server:

In the terminal window where you installed the frontend dependencies, open a new terminal window or tab

cd frontend
npm run dev


###Accessing the Application

Once both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:5173
